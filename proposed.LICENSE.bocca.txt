This software (bocca) is open-source software. Precisely which OSI-approved license
you will eventually find in this space is still being investigated.

However, it is the intention of the bocca developers that:

a) all source code (sh, make, .sidl, c, c++, java, python, f90, f77, 
and any future babel-supported language)
generated by bocca is excluded from any license of bocca. The bocca developers disclaim
any rights to all code generated by application of the bocca tool.

b) users of bocca can develop plugins and other customizations of bocca itself which
are not required to be published or contributed back to the community. If code based
on bocca is distributed without being contributed back to the main line of bocca development,
it must *not* be labeled as being bocca.
