Congratulations!  You have created a Bocca project.  If you want to
see if your project acquired the defaults, look in BOCCA/ for the
defaults file: "<project name>.defaults".

To create an empty component "cd" into the directory where you found
this file and type:

$ bocca create component componentSIDLName  

the resulting component will have no Uses nor Provides Ports but it
will load in a CCA compliant framework like Ccaffeine (and do pretty
much nothing).  More meaningful components can be created by using
some of the many options that "create component" provides.  For more
info type:

$ bocca create component --help

After creating a component type:

$ ./configure; make; make check

This will compile your component and load it into Ccaffeine as a check.

You can customize the bocca-provided configure.ac script by defining new 
m4 macros in the config subdirectory and adding them to the top-level
configure.ac script. After modifying configure.ac, you can regenerate the 
configure script with the following commands in the top-level project 
directory:

$ aclocal -I config
$ autoconf 

Note that autoconf version >= 2.60 is required. New variables set by 
your configure should generally be added to the top-level make.project.in 
file, which is included in all other makefiles.

Good luck!
