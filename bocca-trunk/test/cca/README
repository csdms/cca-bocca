The structure here is a little more rigid for tests to provide simple
methods of finding inputs and what to clean afterward.

Each test should be named test/cca/test_$TEST.sh
where the test script does bocca create project $TEST
and cds into $TEST for further work.
Any sources needed (import, dependency mainly)
should be kept in test/cca/$TEST.src

The clean target then blows away anything named $TEST if there is
a file test_$TEST.sh.
