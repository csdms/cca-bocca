The pattern is 
	bocca [options] verb subject [suboptions] [positional arguments] 

The verbs are like:

create rename change remove etc

The subjects generally are sidl entity or build artifact types.

port, component, interface, class, ...

(bocca create project P; cd P; bocca help) gives the current lists.

Here's the chart of currently supported combinations.

port inst   | * | R | X | * | R | X | X | R | X | X | X |
application |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | R |

	* = draft done
	X = combination not expected to be supported.
	R = needed for "production/robust" but not done.

We need another table of planned arguments and options
for each combination in the above grid, annotated with schedule info.
Less the schedule info, the bocca bug tracker is essentially
the tool that helps us manage this table.
