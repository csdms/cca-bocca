Example setup for CC testing
----------------------------

This directory has example configuration that is being used to test at ANL with
CruiseControl-2.7. 

The following directories should be created in a top-level testing subdirectory:
 
artifacts/bocca/
checkout/bocca/       this is where  a copy of bocca should be checked out from svn
logs/bocca

The following files control the test process:

bocca-cruisecontrol.xml   	bocca project configuration
config.xml			CC configuration (can handle multiple projects if desired)

Starting up CruiseControl can be done with:

./cruisecontrol.sh 

in the top-level testing directory (the one containing config.xml). Note that the CCDIR 
env. variable must be set to point to the top-level CruiseControl directory -- make sure you 
download and build the source distribution, not the binary one.

More detailed instructions on setting up and using CC can be found 
at https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ADIC/wiki/ADIC/SettingUpCruiseControl.
