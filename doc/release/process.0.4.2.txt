This is a record of the 0.4.2 release process (ba,bn).

Set the version number on the trunk to 0.4.2.
svnversion shows 1200. Notably, in 1200AD, the university of paris was founded.
Set the release name to Paris. 
Regenerate configure and commit.
Do clean checkout of bocca/ to scratch area.

Start a new stable branch from the trunk:
svn copy trunk branches/0.4.x

Add files to 0.4.x (these will need to migrate to trunk as appropriate eventually):
 CHANGES INSTALL BUGS

svn commit branches/0.4.x

Tag the release branch:
svn copy 0.4.x ../tags/release-0.4.2
svn commit

Move trunk to next unstable version, 0.5.0 by updating configure.in, configure.

All patches to 0.4.2 should be made to branches/0.4.x.
Treate tags/release-0.4.2 as read-only, for diffs off the original
release.

Whenever releasing a patched 0.4.x, update the svnversion and
increment the patch number (.x) in scripts/bocca, configure.ac
and configure. The 'release' tag (paris) stays the same.
